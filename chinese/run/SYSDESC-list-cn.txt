<SYSDESC>THUIS subtopic mining system (THUIS-S-C-1A): (1) explores search recommendations (provided by NTCIR10), related webpages (Sogou), query log (SogouQ) and semantic descriptions (Wikipedia) to obtain concept-level subtopic candidates of each query; (2) generates expanded queries by re-positioning concepts in the query and inserting prepositional stop words between concepts within the query; (3) inputs the expanded queries to Google search engine to obtain more recommendations and completions, which are also considered subtopic candidates; (4) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights and word frequencies in search result snippets. </SYSDESC>
<SYSDESC>THUIS subtopic mining system (THUIS-S-C-2A): (1) obtains subtopic candidates with THCIS-S-C-1A system; (2) generates expanded queries by re-positioning concepts in the query and inserting prepositional stop words between concepts within the query; (3) clusters subtopic candidates based on semantic similarity with standard AP algorithm; (4) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights, semantic clusters and word frequencies in search result snippets.</SYSDESC>
<SYSDESC>THUIS subtopic mining system (THCIS-S-C-3A): (1) obtains subtopic candidates with THUIS-S-C-1A system; (2) generates expanded queries by re-positioning concepts in the query and inserting prepositional stop words between concepts within the query; (3) clusters subtopic candidates based on semantic similarity with a revised AP algorithm; (4) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights, semantic clusters and word frequencies in search result snippets.</SYSDESC>
