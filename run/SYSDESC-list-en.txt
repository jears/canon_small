<SYSDESC>THCIB subtopic mining system (THCIB-S-E-1A): (1) explores search recommendations (provided by NTCIR10), search completions (provided by NTCIR10), related webpages (Google), query log (ClueWeb09) and semantic descriptions (Wikipedia) to obtain concept-level subtopic candidates of each query; (2) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights and word frequencies in search result snippets. </SYSDESC>
<SYSDESC>THCIB subtopic mining system (THCIB-S-E-2A): (1) obtains subtopic candidates with THCIB-S-E-1A system; (2) generates expanded queries by re-positioning concepts in the query and inserting prepositional stop words between concepts within the query; (3) inputs the expanded queries to Google to obtain more recommendations and completions, which are also considered subtopic candidates; (4) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights and word frequencies in search result snippets. </SYSDESC>
<SYSDESC>THCIB subtopic mining system (THCIB-S-E-3A): (1) obtains subtopic candidates with THCIB-S-E-2A system; (2) generalize subtopic candidates with Freebase so as to associate named entities with the same ontology type to some ontological clusters; (3) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights, ontological clusters and word frequencies in search result snippets.</SYSDESC>
<SYSDESC>THCIB subtopic mining system (THCIB-S-E-4A): (1) obtains subtopic candidates with THCIB-S-E-2A system; (2) generalize subtopic candidates with Freebase so as to associate named entities with the same ontology type to some ontological clusters; (3) clusters subtopic candidates based on semantic similarity with standard AP algorithm; (4) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights, ontological clusters, semantic clusters and word frequencies in search result snippets.</SYSDESC>
<SYSDESC>THCIB subtopic mining system (THCIB-S-E-5A): (1) obtains subtopic candidates with THCIB-S-E-2A system; (2) generalize subtopic candidates with Freebase so as to associate named entities with the same ontology type to some ontological clusters; (3) clusters subtopic candidates based on semantic similarity with a revised AP algorithm; (4) ranks the subtopic candidates according to source weights, ontological clusters, semantic clusters and word frequencies in search result snippets.</SYSDESC>
